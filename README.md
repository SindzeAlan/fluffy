## What are the major types of mobile apps
Mobile apps are software applications developed specifically to run and be used on small wireless computing devices such as smartphones and tablets rather than larger devices like desktops.
Mobile apps can  be classified based on various criteria. One of them is based on the technology used
There are three major types in this category:
- Native applications
Native applications are targeted towards a particular OS and are very platform specific. They are developed using a programming language targeted specifically towards that particular platform or operating system. Native apps are compiled directly into machine instructions, and do not need any middleware to run on their targeted platform and they are therefore the fastest and most performant type of applications that can be developed on a mobile device.
Examples of some programming languages used in native development are Kotlin, Java, Swift.
- Hybrid or cross-platform applications
These types of apps are not platform specific, and can therefore run on various different operating systems. They are developed using either web technologies, or a programming language that can be compiled to different target systems executables. These applications are convenient because with one code base, the same application can be developed for different target systems.
Examples of technologies used for cross-platform/hybrid app development are: Flutter, react native and Ionic.
- Web applications
These are applications that look and feel like native mobile applications, but are actually web applications that run on an integrated browser engine on the mobile device.
Examples of technologies used for web app development are: React, angular and svelte.

## Differences between the major types of mobile app
### Interm of performance	maintenance	Device feature
#### Native Apps
- Faster and better performance	Updates must be done frequently to maintain the software
- Can access device features
#### Web App
- Performance is dependent on the browser used
- Easier to maintain
- May not always integrate with device hard ware
#### Hybrid Apps
- Has better performance when compared to web apps
- Requires the downloading of certain elements to maintai
- Certain features might not be usable on devices
## Review mobile app programming languages
Some of the most popular programming languages used for mobile app development are:
- Java
Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented, general purpose programming language used in a variety of fields. Java is a language that compiles to byte-code. This compiled byte-code can then run on any machine with the Java Virtual Machine. Hence, java code can be run everywhere, including mobile devices where it is extensively used. It is used for android applications development.
- Kotlin
Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose high-level programming language with type inference. Kotlin is designed to interoperate fully with Java, and even runs on the Java Virtual Machine(JVM). Kotlin is the new standard for developing android mobile applications and is even backed by Google.
- Swift
Swift is a high-level general-purpose, multi-paradigm, compiled programming language developed by Apple Inc. It is used for development of applications for Apple products, this includes mobile phones, Apple tv, Apple watch etc.
- Dart
Dart is an object-oriented, statically-typed programming language designed by Google. It has a C-like syntax, and can be used in combination with the Flutter framework to build highly performant mobile applications. The flutter framework is cross-platform, and can therefore compile one code base to various target operating systems.
- JavaScript
JavaScript is the programming language of the web. This is the language that is used for developing dynamic web applications. It does not naturally compile to mobile platforms, but a JavaScript engine can be used to convert the JavaScript code to a mobile application. Although slightly less performant than the other languages listed above, JavaScript has the advantage of being dynamic and easy to learn. JavaScript apps are also cross-platform so one code base can be used to deploy to various platforms.
Frameworks using Javascript include:React native and Ionic.
- C#(C-sharp)
C# is a general-purpose high-level programming language supporting multiple paradigms. C# encompasses static typing, strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines. It can be used in combination with the Xamarin framework to create cross-platform mobile applications.
## Mobile app development framework
A mobile app development framework provides developers with a structured way to build mobile apps quickly and efficiently. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and guidelines that are used to create mobile applications. A framework can provide pre-built components, code snippets, and templates that can help developers save time and effort in the development process. It can also ensure consistency across the app, making it easier to maintain and update.
## Cost estimation of a mobile app
-------------------------------------------------------
|Framework|Language|Time|Developer experience|Cost|
---------------------------------------------------
|React Native|Javascript|Low|Once developers already know Javascript, React native can be easy to learn and use for development|Low cost because one codebase is used for different platforms|
|Flutter|Dart|Low|Developers should master the dart programming language to develop in flutter, but once done, cross-platform apps can be developed|Low cost because one codebase is used for different platforms|
|Xamarin|C# (C-sharp)|medium|Developers knowing C# can easily pick-up the Xamarin framework and start development of cross-platform app|Low cost because Xamarin is cross-platform|
------------------------------------------------

## Collection and analysis of requirements for mobile applications
The following steps outline the techniques used for gathering information for the development of a mobile application:
- Brainstorming
Brainstorming aims at gathering as many ideas as possible from a group of people, while reflecting on a common idea.
- Identify the stakeholders
Stakeholders are people or organizations with a vested interest in the app, such as end-users, business owners, and technical teams. Identify who they are and reach out to them to understand their requirements.
- Identify the goals
Identify the goals of the mobile app, such as improving a process, increasing user engagement, or generating revenue. This will help you to determine the key features and functionalities that need to be included in the app.
- Gather user requirements
Create a user persona, conduct surveys, and organize focus group sessions to gather feedback on what features they would like to see in the app. This data will help you better understand user needs and preferences.
- Prototyping
Prototyping is a new way of gathering requirements where with the initial requirements of the software an initial version of the software is built(prototype), this is later shown to the client who then gives additional requirements, the proper adjustments are done and cycle around the client again repeatedly until the final output is produced.
## How to estimate the cost of building a mobile application
The cost of mobile app development greatly depends on the requirements of app been developed, the nature of the app been developed, the complexity of the app been developed and most importantly the purpose of the app been developed.
The normal way to determine the cost of production of a mobile app is shown down below
Total development time * hourly cost = cost
Usually app development companies use 2 main charging approaches
- Fixed Charge approach
This is a way of charging for small projects with strict timeline of completion and predefined scope of work, the main advantage of this approach is the clarity in app development cost
- Time and material
This approach for charging for mobile apps has an advantage of been more flexible when compared to the fix charged approach, this approach is mostly used for complex projects with unexpected turns. The pricing is usually done on hourly rate and time spent on development and usage of resources.
