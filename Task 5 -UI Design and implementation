###INTRODUCTION :

Let’s start with an overview of what is software design in software engineering. It is the process of creating software methods, functions, objects, and the general structure and interaction of your code such that the resulting functionality meets the needs of your users. There are numerous approaches to software design. Various developers prefer varying levels of design upfront or during the execution process. Generally, before beginning coding , the overall design should be thoroughly thought out and reviewed. It is easier to try out different designs early in the development cycle and find problems than to make a significant design change after most of the code has been written. 


##Objectives of Software Design

The following objectives describe what is software design in software engineering.

**Correctness** : A good design should be correct, which means that it should correctly implement all of the system’s features.

**Efficiency**: A good soft ware design should consider resources, time, and cost optimization parameters.

**Understandability** : A good design should be easy to grasp, which is why it should be modular, with all parts organized in layers.

**Completeness**: The design should include all components, such as data structures,modules,and external interfaces, among others.

**Maintainability** : A good software design should be flexible when the client issues a modification request. 


#Levels of Software Design 

There are 3 levels of software design.

1.	Architectural Design
A system’s  architecture can be defined as the system’s overall structure and how that structure offers conceptual integrity to the system. The architectural design characterizes the software as a system with numerous interconnected components. The designers acquire an overview of the proposed solution domain at this level.

2.	High-level Design
The high level design deconstructs the architectural design’s single entity-multiple component notion into a less abstract perspective of subsystems and modules, depicting their interaction with one another. High level design is concerned with how the system and it’s components can be implemented as modules. It recognizes the modular structure of each subsystem, as well as their relationship and interaction with one another.

3.	Detailed Design 
After the high level design is completed, the detailed design begins. Each module is extensively investigated at this level of software design to establish the data structures and algorithms to be used. Finally, a module specification document is used to document the stage’s outcome. It defines the logical structure of each module as well as it’s interfaces with other modules. 



##USER INTERFACE (UI) Design

User Interface (UI) design is the process designers use to build interfaces in software or computerized devices, focusing on looks or style. Designers aim to create interfaces which users find easy to use and other forms.

#Designing User Interfaces for Users

User interfaces are the access points where users interact with designs. They come in three formats :

1.	Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) : Users interact with visual representations on digital control panels. A computer’s desktop is a GUI.
2.	Voice Controlled interfaces (VUIs) : Users interact with these through their voices. Most smart assistant eg Siri on iPhone and alexa on amazon devices are VUIs.

3.	Gesture-based interfaces : User engage with 3D design spaces through bodily motions. Eg: in Virtual Reality(VR) games.

To design UIs best, we should consider:

-	Users judge designs quickly and care about usabilty and likeability.
-	They don’t care about your design, but about getting their tasks done easily and with minimum effort.
-	Your design should therefore be “invisible”: Users shouldn’t focus on it but on completing tasks: e.g., ordering pizza on Domino’s Zero Click app.
-	So, understand your users’ contexts and task flows to fine-tune the best, most intuitive UIs that deliver seamless experiences.

-	UIs should also be enjoyable (or at least satisfying and frustration-free).
-	When your design predicts users’ needs, they can enjoy more personal-ized and immersive experiences. Delight them, and they’ll keep returning.
-	Where appropriate, elements of gamification can make your design more fun.
-	UIs should communicate brand values and reinforce users’ trust.
-	Good design is emotional design. Users associate good feelings with brands that speak to them at all levels and keep the magic of pleasurable, seamless experiences alive.


##Tools used for UI Design 
 
There are several tools used in UI design. Some are :


**Adobe XD**
Adobe XD is a vector-based user experience design tool for web apps and mobile apps. Fast, powerful and just the right amount of everything. Ideas are turned into stunning reality, faster. XD is packed with tools to help you effortlessly design websites, apps, voice and so much more.

**Figma**
Figma is a browser-based tool, hence, it is not limited to working on macOS like Sketch, it can also be operated on Windows, Linus, and Chromebook as well. It offers a web API that too free of cost.

**Adobe Illustrator**
An illustration is a decoration, interpretation or visual explanation of a text, concept or process, designed for integration in published media, such as posters, flyers, magazines, books, teaching materials, animations, video games and films. An illustration is typically created by an illustrator.

In the development of this project, we used Adobe XD for the UI design and HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT for the implementation.

## User Interfaces
The following paragraph deals with the various user interfaces that will be available in the market management system

The application is built as a web application so there is both a mobile view and a desktop view 
some interfaces include:

for login in the mobile view 
IMG-20230527-WA0010.jpg
for dashboard in the desktop view

now some interfaces that will be in the desktop view include

login as shown in the desktop view

dashboard for the buyers as shown in the desktop view
