# Data Collection

## Technique Used
### Survey
We decided to use a survey as a technique for gathering information for the development of our mobile application. The theme of the survey was "How individuals determine the market price of goods?" The questions were open-ended to allow stakeholders to freely express their opinions. Our target audience was the population of Buea, including students and elders. We asked the following questions to our stakeholders:

1. Do you frequently visit the market? This question is important to understand if our stakeholders go to the market regularly.
2. Which markets do you typically visit? Since each market has its own particularities, we want to know the kind of market where our stakeholders usually go.
3. How do you determine the market price of a good? This question aims to allow our stakeholders to share their methods of estimation.
4. In your opinion, what factors influence changes in market prices? We want to know the external factors that influence the market.

By analyzing the responses to these questions, we aimed to identify key trends and patterns, compare results, and draw conclusions that would help us develop a mobile application that meets the needs of our stakeholders.

### Brainstorming
As developers, we also participated in brainstorming sessions to gain insights into our target audience's decision-making processes. Our questions were:

- How does a person estimate the price of a good before going to the market?
- How does a person know how the market price of a good changes over time?
