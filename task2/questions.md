# Collection of data

## Technique used
### Survey
We have decided to use a survey as a technique for gathering information for the development of our mobile application. The theme of the survey is "How individuals determine the market price of goods?".
As audience, we have selected the population of Buea (student and elder).
We asked the following questions to our stakeholders:

1. Do you frequently visit the market? This question is important to understand if our stakeholders go to the market regularly.
2. Which markets do you typically visit? Since each market has its own particularities, we want to know the kind of market where our stakeholders usually go.
3. How do you determine the market price of a good? This question aims to allow our stakeholders to share their methods of estimation.
4. In your opinion, what factors influence changes in market prices? We want to know the external factors that influence the market.

By analyzing the responses to these questions, we aim to identify key trends and patterns, compare results, and draw conclusions that will help us develop a mobile application that meets the needs of our stakeholders.

### Brainstorming

- How do a person to estimate the price of a good before go to market?
- How do a person to know how the market price of a good change in the time?
