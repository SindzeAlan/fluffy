# Analyzing of data

## How the analyze has been done
To analyze the data collected, we decided to follow some general steps on how to analyze and get information from a survey:

1. Clean and organize the data: Remove any incomplete or irrelevant responses, and organize the data in a way that makes it easy to analyze.

2. Identify key trends and patterns: Look for patterns in the data by analyzing the responses to each question. Identify any key trends or patterns that emerge.

3. Create visualizations: Use graphs, charts, and other visualizations to help you understand the data and communicate your findings.

4. Compare results: Compare the results of different questions or sections of the survey to identify any correlations or relationships between different variables.

5. Draw conclusions: Use the data to draw conclusions about the survey topic. Identify any key insights or recommendations that can be made based on the data.

6. Share your findings: Communicate your findings to others who are interested in the survey results. This might include stakeholders, clients, or other members of your team.
