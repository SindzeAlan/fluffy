# Analysis of Data

## How the Analysis was Done
To analyze the data collected at [ [Task 2](../task2/questions.md) ], we followed some general steps on how to analyze and get information from a survey:

1. Clean and organize the data: Remove any incomplete or irrelevant responses and organize the data in a way that makes it easy to analyze.

2. Identify key trends and patterns: Look for patterns in the data by analyzing the responses to each question. Identify any key trends or patterns that emerge.

3. Compare results: Compare the results of different questions or sections of the survey to identify any correlations or relationships between different variables.

4. Draw conclusions: Use the data to draw conclusions about the survey topic. Identify any key insights or recommendations that can be made based on the data.

5. Share your findings: Communicate your findings to others who are interested in the survey results. This might include stakeholders, clients, or other members of your team.

## Analysis
We found that:

- The majority of participants (12/14 -> 85%) go frequently to the market.
- 4/14 -> 30% estimate the price of an item by its quality, 2 participants by experience, or by consulting other people.
- 4/14 -> 20% visit more than one market.
- 5/14 -> 35% think that the market price changes by period.
- 1 participant thinks that the market price is a function of the location.

## Results
After analyzing the collected data, we can say that the market price should be estimated based on:

- Experience
- Quality of the good
- Location
- Period

From these key elements, we can derive the following requirements:

- The application should act as a consultant.
- The application should be able to estimate the market price based on user inputs.
- The application should take into account major events that can influence the market price.
- The application should be able to learn from previous estimations and propose a better one.
